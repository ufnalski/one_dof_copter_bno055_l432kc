# 1-DOF copter portable demonstrator (STM32L432KC)
An STM32 HAL example of PID control for a 1-DOF copter. The demo features an ESC (electronic speed controller) that supports DShot (Digital Shot) protocol, and an AHRS from Bosch Sensortec.

# Motivation
When you have an [ESC](https://github.com/ufnalski/dshot_pwm_dma_l432kc) and an [AHRS](https://github.com/ufnalski/ahrs_bno055_g474re) up your sleeve you should definitely combine them into a 1-DOF copter! Such a copter poses an excellent plant[^1] to elevate your control system design skills. Let's then play with practical PID controllers. Integrator anti-windup and band-limited differentiator will be your best companions for that journey.

# Missing files?
Don't worry :slightly_smiling_face: Just hit Alt-K to generate /Drivers/CMCIS/ and /Drivers/STM32L4xx_HAL_Driver/ based on the .ioc file. After a couple of seconds your project will be ready for building.

# Exemplary hardware
* Talon32 Slim 40A AM32[^2] 128K 3-6S (Skystars)
* V2306/V2207 V3.0 VELOX 2550KV (T-MOTOR)
* HQProp S4 Lemon Lime (Ethix)
* 2200mAh 11.1V 30C 3S1P LiPo battery (Gens ace)

[^2]: They used to be shipped with the BLHeli_32 firmware. Recently the manufacturer switched to the AM32 firmware. Both of them support DShot300 and can be used interchangeably in this mini-project if DShot300 is selected. Similar exchangeability is not possible if DShot150 is opt for - the AM32 firmware does not support DShot150, which is totally understandable within the context of modern drones.
